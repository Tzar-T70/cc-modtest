# Confronting Yourself (WIP title)

A (hopefully) simple CrossCode mod that adds a room, in which you must crack some codes to form a sentence, in a nutshell.

Made by a Cyber Security student who's tryna make a cool project in a game he loves, using the cryptography shi he's learnt. üòÅüëç



## Roadmap

- Add a Room in Ba'kii Kum to the right of the big teleporter

    - try using vermillion wasteland tileset in room

- add npcs spread throughout room - dialogue made up of encrypted text

    - each npcs dialogue is encrypted using different words as keys
    - those words form a sentence, maybe a riddle of some kind
    - npcs could be ppl leas spoken to, on sum 'set in her mind' type shi


## Potential Features

Easy:

- change up npc sprites a lil to make things different type shi

Medium:

- try making an item where after picking it up n speaking to an NPC, it makes the encrypted text appear when speaking to the other npcs in the room.


Hard:

- see if room can only be shown after lea's breakdown in Ch5
- try making a cutscene to tie events together
- make a puzzle which uses the sentence formed from all the decrypted words to reveal sum
